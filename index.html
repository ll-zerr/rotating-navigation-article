      <h1>Mikey's Legacy</h1> 
      <small>Kacey Zander</small>
      <p>Mikey touched the hearts of all that knew him. This horse was an incredible teacher with amazing patience. He helped my husband discover the best approach for training horses by very clearly indicating that an application of various styles would yield better results. He showed my children that it’s okay to hold on to your youthful spunk and vigour even in your old age.  He taught us that porcupine quills are better removed by a vet than your owners. He was a steadfast companion and a great partner for adventurous expeditions. He was one of our first horses and he will be a model to which those that follow shall be compared.</p>
    
      <h3>Mikey <span>(2000 - 2023)</span></h3>
      <img src="img/mikey_dusk2.png" alt="black horse"/>
      <p>Mikey was born April 14th, 2000. He started out small but grew into a gorgeous pure black Quarter horse. He was always playful in the pastures and remained loyal to his lifelong friend, an Appaloosa named Dancer, even after Dancer had passed.  Mikey’s legacy will stand true through the test of time – every adventure is worthy of a try and the heart knows no boundaries when it comes to love.</p>
